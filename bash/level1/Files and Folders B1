# 🐚 Bash Track – Level 1: Files & Folders
# 🎉 Welcome to your first Bash challenge!
#
# 📘 Scenario
# Imagine you are organizing your STEAM project folders.
# You need a folder for "projects" and inside it, a file called "ideas.txt".
#
# 📝 Your task is to:
# 1. Create a new folder named: projects
# 2. Inside that folder, create a file named: ideas.txt
# 3. Write the text "My first STEAM idea" into ideas.txt
#
# 👉 Work in GitHub Codespaces (open the Terminal).
#    Type `bash bash/level1.sh` to run your script.
#
# HINTS
# • mkdir = make directory
# • touch = create a file
# • echo "text" > file = write text into a file
#
# Example:
# mkdir test_folder
# touch test_folder/test.txt
# echo "hello" > test_folder/test.txt
#
# 🚀 After you finish:
# - Commit & Push your changes
# - Check Actions for ✅ or ❌

# ✅ YOUR CODE (replace the TODOs below)
mkdir projects         # TODO: make the folder
touch projects/ideas.txt  # TODO: create the file
echo "My first STEAM idea" > projects/ideas.txt  # TODO: write into it

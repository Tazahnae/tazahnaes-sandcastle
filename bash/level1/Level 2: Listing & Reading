<!-- 🐚 Bash Track – Level 2: Listing & Reading
🎉 Great job making your first folder and file!

📘 Scenario
You’ve added files, but now you need to check what’s inside.

📝 Your task is to:
1. List all files in the projects folder
2. Show what’s inside ideas.txt
3. Add a second idea into the file without erasing the first

👉 Work in Codespaces.
Open the Terminal and run: bash bash/level2.sh
Then Commit & Push, and check Actions.

💡 Commands to learn:
- ls → list files
- cat → read file contents
- echo "text" >> file → add text without erasing

# 🚀 Student Quick Start — GETTING STARTED (STEAMforME)

Welcome, Steamers! 👋 This is your guide to start coding in **Tazahnae’s SandCastle**.  
Follow these steps to complete your levels and earn your badge.

---

## 1️⃣ Open Your Assignment
- If your teacher gave you a **GitHub Classroom link** → click it.  
  - This will automatically create your assignment repo.  
- **If not, use the template:**  
  👉 <https://github.com/Tazahnae/tazahnaes-sandcastle>  
  - Click **Use this template**  
  - Name it (example: `my-sandcastle`)  
   

💡 No setup needed: you don’t need to install Python on your laptop — everything runs in Codespaces.

# 🐚 Bash Track — Student Quick Start (READ THIS FIRST)

Welcome, STEAM Coder! 🎉  
This page shows you **how** to do Bash levels in **GitHub Codespaces**, what the words mean, and how to check your work in **Actions**.

> **Do this first:** Open your assignment in **Codespaces**  
> Click **Code → Open with Codespaces → New codespace**.

## 🧰 What is Bash?
Bash is the **language of the Terminal**. It lets you talk to your computer with text commands to create folders, make files, and organize things.

- **Terminal:** the box at the bottom where you type commands.
- **Script:** a file full of commands (example: `level1_files_and_folders.sh`) that you can run.

---

## 🚀 How to Run a Level (every time)

1. **Open Codespaces** (see above).
2. **Open the Terminal** (bottom of the screen).  
   If it’s not open: **View → Terminal**.
3. **Run the level script** by typing one command:

   ```bash
   # Level 1
   bash bash/level1_files_and_folders.sh

   # Level 2
   bash bash/level2_listing_and_reading.sh

   # Level 3
   bash bash/level3_moving_and_renaming.sh

   # Level 4
   bash bash/level4_loops_and_repetition.sh

   # Level 5
   bash bash/level5_final_project.sh

4.	Read the Terminal output (it tells you what happened).
	5.	Commit & Push to save your work:
	•	Click Source Control (left side).
	•	Type a short message (example: finish bash level 2).
	•	Click Commit & Push (or Sync Changes).

🔑 Key Git Commands (behind the scenes)
Even though Codespaces often does this for you with a button, here’s what’s happening:
	•	git add → tells Git which files you want to save (stage changes).
	•	git commit -m “message” → takes a snapshot of your work (like a checkpoint in a game).
	•	git push → uploads your saved work (commits) to GitHub (the cloud).
	•	git pull → brings down the newest updates from GitHub into your Codespace.

👉 In Codespaces you mostly click Commit & Push, but it’s good to know these words because professionals use them every day.✅ How to Check Your Work (GitHub Actions)
	1.	Go to your repo on the GitHub website.
	2.	Click the Actions tab.
	3.	Open the latest run (you’ll see your message like “finish bash level 2”).
	4.	Look for:
	•	✅ Green check → You passed!
	•	❌ Red X → Something to fix. Go back to Codespaces, edit, Commit & Push again.

If you don’t see Actions yet, ask your teacher—they may grade by reading your Terminal output.

🧠 Words You’ll See (Simple Definitions)
	•	mkdir — make a folder
	•	touch — make an empty file
	•	echo “text” > file — write text into a file (replace what was there)
	•	echo “text” >> file — add text to the end (keep old text)
	•	ls — list what’s in a folder
	•	cat file — show what’s inside a file
	•	mv — move or rename a file
	•	for loop — repeat a command many times
	•	set -e — “If something goes wrong, stop the script.” (used in your level files)

⸻

🗺️ What Each Level Teaches
	•	Level 1 – Files & Folders: make a project folder and your first idea file
	•	Level 2 – Listing & Reading: list files, read a file, add more text safely
	•	Level 3 – Moving & Renaming: rename a file and move it to an archive
	•	Level 4 – Loops & Repetition: create multiple files fast with a loop
	•	Level 5 – Final Project: organize everything into one neat folder and show the result

Each level also has a short scenario in the script comments so you know why you’re doing it.

⸻

🧩 Common Gotchas (quick fixes)
	•	“command not found”
You might have typed the command wrong. Check spelling and spaces.
	•	“No such file or directory”
Make sure the folder/file exists. Try ls to see what’s there.
	•	File names with spaces
Our scripts are named with underscores (like level3_moving_and_renaming.sh) so you don’t need quotes. Stick to these names.
	•	Actions didn’t run
Push again, or check that you committed to the main branch.

🏆 Progress Checklist (Badge Board – Bash)

Mark each box when your Actions run shows a ✅:
	•	Level 1 — Files & Folders
	•	Level 2 — Listing & Reading
	•	Level 3 — Moving & Renaming
	•	Level 4 — Loops & Repetition
	•	Level 5 — Final Project

When all boxes are checked, show your teacher to earn your STEAM Bash Certificate! 🎓

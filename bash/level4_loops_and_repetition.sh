<!-- 🐚 Bash Track – Level 4: Loops & Repetition
🎉 Let’s make Bash do the hard work for you!

📘 Scenario
Instead of making files one by one, you’ll use a loop to create many at once.

📝 Your task is to:
1. In the projects folder, use a loop to make 5 files:
   day1.txt, day2.txt, day3.txt, day4.txt, day5.txt
2. Each file should contain:
   STEAM Log Day X (replace X with the day number)

👉 Work in Codespaces.
Open the Terminal and run: bash bash/level4.sh
Then Commit & Push, and check Actions.

💡 Command to learn:
- for loop in Bash

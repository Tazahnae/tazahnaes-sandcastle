# 🐍 Exercise 5: The Final Challenge — Score Helper
# 🌟 You made it to the FINAL BOSS, STEAM Coder! 🌟
#
# This is where you put EVERYTHING together:
#   ⚡ Functions
#   ⚡ Variables
#   ⚡ Loops
#   ⚡ Conditionals
#
# 📝 Your Mission
# Build a “Score Helper” that can:
# 1) Greet a student by name
# 2) Add two numbers
# 3) Sum up a list of scores
# 4) Check if a number is even
# 5) Analyze a list of scores:
#      → total, average, highest, lowest, how many evens, how many odds
#
# 💡 Remember:
# No step-by-step this time — this is YOUR chance to show what you’ve learned.
#
# 🧪 Test Like a Pro
# In Codespaces → open the Terminal → type: python
# Import your functions:
#   from python.level1.project_05 import greet, add_two, sum_scores, is_even, analyze_scores
#
# Try them out one by one… just like a real coder! 🚀
# Exit Python when done: exit() or Ctrl+D
#
# 🎉 Win Condition
# If your functions work, you’ve conquered Python Level 5.
# Mark your Badge Board → Python Track ✅ Complete
# and celebrate — you’re officially a Python Explorer! 🏆

# TODO 1: Write a function greet(name) → "Hello, <name>"
# TODO 2: Write a function add_two(a, b) → sum of a and b
# TODO 3: Write a function sum_scores(scores) → total using a loop
# TODO 4: Write a function is_even(n) → True if even, else False
# TODO 5: Write a function analyze_scores(scores) → return summary dictionary

## 🌍 What is Python?
Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.  
It’s used for:
- **Websites** (Instagram, YouTube, Spotify)
- **Games** (Minecraft mods)
- **Science & AI** (NASA, Google, ChatGPT!)
- **Everyday automation** (making computers do boring tasks for you)

Why Python?  
Because it’s **simple to read, easy to learn, and powerful**. Perfect for beginners AND pros.



## ✨ What You’ll Learn in Level 1
- How to **print text** and talk to your computer
- Using **variables** to store and use information
- Writing **functions** (inputs → outputs)
- Using **loops** to repeat actions
- Checking your work with **tests in GitHub**

---

## 📖 Key Definitions
- **Function** → A reusable block of code that does one job.  
- **Parameter** → The input a function needs (like `name` or a number).  
- **Return value** → The answer your function sends back.  
- **Variable** → A named box that stores a value (like a number or a word).  
- **Loop** → A way to repeat actions until a condition is met.  
- **Conditional** → A decision maker (`if` something is true, do this).  

---

## 💻 First Simple Commands
Try these in Codespaces → Terminal → type `python`:

```python
print("Hello, world!")        # Your first output
x = 5 + 3                     # A variable storing 8
print(x)                      # Shows 8
for i in range(3):            # A loop repeating 3 times
    print("STEAM rocks!")

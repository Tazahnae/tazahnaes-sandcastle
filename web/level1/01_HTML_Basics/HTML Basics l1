## 🌟 Scenario: “Your Digital Introduction Page”  
You’ve been hired as a **junior web developer** for *STEAM Stories*, a digital magazine where every young innovator shares their journey into science and creativity.  
Your first assignment is to design a **personal introduction webpage** that tells visitors who you are, what you’re passionate about, and one big dream you have for the future.  

This page will be the **foundation** of your future portfolio — it’s your space to introduce yourself to the world! 🌍

## 📝 Task: Build Your “About Me” Web Page  

👉 **Your mission:**  
Use HTML to create a simple but professional-looking “About Me” page that includes the following elements:  

1. **A Title for Your Page**  
   - Add this inside your `<head>` section:  
     ```html
     <title>About Me | [Your Name]</title>
     ```
   > 🧠 *Definition:* The `<title>` tag gives your webpage its name — it appears at the top of the browser tab.  

2. **A Main Heading (`<h1>`)**  
   - Use your heading to introduce yourself.  
     ```html
     <h1>Welcome to My Web Page!</h1>
     ```
   - Feel free to make it more personal, like:  
     ```html
     <h1>Meet [Your Name] — A Future Engineer in Training</h1>
     ```

3. **A Short Introduction Paragraph (`<p>`)**  
   - Write 3–4 sentences introducing yourself.  
     Include your favorite subject, one hobby, and what you hope to learn in STEAM for Me.  
     ```html
     <p>
       Hi! My name is [Your Name]. I’m passionate about technology and helping others learn new things. 
       I love building creative projects and hope to become a software engineer who makes tools that help communities.
     </p>
     ```
   > 🧠 *Definition:* The `<p>` tag creates a paragraph. It’s used to add body text to your page.  

4. **A Fun Quote or Motto**  
   - Add a second paragraph that includes a quote or phrase that inspires you.  
     ```html
     <p><em>"Learning never stops — every day is a chance to grow!"</em></p>
     ```
   > 🧠 *Definition:* The `<em>` tag italicizes text and helps emphasize a phrase.  

5. **Add a Background Color (Optional)**  
   - Inside your `<body>` tag, add a *style attribute* to personalize your page:  
     ```html
     <body style="background-color:lightyellow;">
     ```

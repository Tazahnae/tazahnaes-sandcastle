## 🌟 Scenario  
You’ve been asked to make a **“Student Spotlight”** page for your class site. It needs two sections side-by-side:  
- **Left:** “About Me” (a short bio)  
- **Right:** “My Favorites” (a short list—music, food, games, books, etc.)  

Your page should look organized and balanced, like a real profile page you’d see on a school website.

## 📝 Task  
👉 **Your task is to:**  
1. Create a `<div>` with class `"container"`.  
2. Add two `<div class="box">` sections (About Me, My Favorites).  
3. Use CSS Flexbox so the boxes sit side-by-side.

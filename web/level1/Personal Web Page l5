<!-- 🌐 Web Track – Level 5: Final Project – Personal Web Page
🏆 FINAL LEVEL! You’ve made it to the end of the Web Development Track.

📘 Scenario
You are now a web developer! This is your chance to design a personal web page 
that represents YOU. At this level you will also deploy your page LIVE 
using GitHub Pages so anyone can see it.

📝 Your task is to:
✅ Combine everything from Levels 1–4:
   - A heading and paragraph (Level 1)
   - A link + image (Level 2)
   - CSS styles (Level 3)
   - Flexbox layout (Level 4)
✅ Add your own creative touch — lists, colors, more sections!

👉 Check docs/Student_Quickstart_Web.md for step-by-step instructions 
on Codespaces, Commit & Push, Actions, and deploying with GitHub Pages.

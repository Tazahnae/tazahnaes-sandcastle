## 📝 Task: Add Color and Font with CSS

👉 **Your mission:** Link a CSS file and add a few basic styles.

1. **Create and link your CSS file**
   - In your folder `web/level2/`, create a new file called `style.css`.
   - Open your `index.html` and inside the `<head>` section add:
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
     ```
   > 🧠 *Definition:* `<link rel="stylesheet">` tells your page to use your style rules from another file.

2. **Set a background color**
   In `style.css`, type:
   ```css
   body {
     background-color: lightblue;
   }

	3.	Change your text color and font

h1 {
  color: darkblue;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

p {
  color: navy;
  font-size: 18px;
}


	4.	Preview your page
	•	Click the 🌐 Preview icon or right-click index.html → Open Preview
	•	Try changing lightblue to another color like lavender, mintcream, or peachpuff — experiment!
	5.	Save & Push your work

git add .
git commit -m "level2: added color and font style"
git push

Then check your Actions tab — ✅ means success!

## 🌟 Scenario: “Show & Share Your World”

Your page has great information — now it’s time to make it **come alive**!  
Your editor at *STEAM Stories* wants to feature your page in the **Digital Dreamers Gallery**, but before it can go live, they’ve asked you to include at least one image and a few links.  

Think of this as giving your visitors **windows into your world** — a picture of what inspires you, and links that show what you care about or what you’ve learned. 🌻

## 📝 Task: Add an Image and a Link  

👉 **Your mission:** Add one image and at least one working link to your webpage.  

1. **Add an image**
   - Open your file `web/level3/index.html`.  
   - Inside the `<body>` section, below your paragraph, add:
     ```html
     <img src="https://placekitten.com/300/300" alt="My favorite animal" width="300" height="300">
     ```
   > 🧠 *Definition:* The **`<img>`** tag shows a picture.  
   > - **`src`** = where the image lives online  
   > - **`alt`** = short description for screen readers or if the image doesn’t load

   🎯 *Try replacing the link* with a picture that matches your hobbies (ask your instructor for an approved image link).

2. **Add a link**
   - Under your image, add a link to something you find inspiring:
     ```html
     <p>
       Learn more about space at 
       <a href="https://www.nasa.gov" target="_blank">NASA .gov</a>!
     </p>
     ```
   > 🧠 *Definition:* The **`<a>`** tag (anchor) creates a hyperlink.  
   > - **`href`** = the website address  
   > - **`target="_blank"`** opens the link in a new tab

3. **Preview your page**
   - Click the 🌐 *Preview* icon or right-click `index.html` → **Open Preview**  
   - Make sure your image appears and your link opens correctly.

4. **Save and Upload (Commit & Push)**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "level3: added image and link to about-me page"
   git push

	Go to your Actions tab → look for ✅ success!
	•	❌ means something needs fixing — use your Quick Start Guide for help.

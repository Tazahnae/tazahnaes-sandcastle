# 🧰 Git & GitHub Reference — How to Save, Commit, and Check Actions

Git helps you **track your work** and **save versions** of your project as you build.  
GitHub is where those versions live in the cloud — like Google Drive for code.

When you finish a level or task, you’ll use these core commands: 
🧠 Summary — The Git Save Flow
1 git add .Stage your changes
2 git commit -m "message"Save your changes locally
3 git push - Upload your work to GitHub
4 (optional) git pull Download latest version
5 (check) git status See what’s changed
✅ Viewing GitHub “Actions” (Checking if Your Work Runs Correctly)

GitHub Actions automatically checks your code when you push.
It helps confirm if your pages, structure, or scripts are working correctly.

To open Actions:
	1.	Go to your GitHub repository page.
	2.	Click the “Actions” tab at the top (next to “Code,” “Issues,” “Pull requests”).
	3.	You’ll see a list of recent runs.

🟢 Green Check = Passed → Your code ran successfully.
🔴 Red X = Failed → There’s an error. Click the run to see details.

Inside the Actions page:
	•	Each workflow is like a test run.
	•	You can click on any failed run to see:
	•	Which file failed
	•	The line or command that caused the error

If your workflow fails:
	•	Double-check that your folder and file names match the assignment.
	•	Make sure every folder has an index.html and proper capitalization.
	•	Commit & push again after fixing.
🧩 Example: Full Workflow

Let’s say you finished Level 2 (Links & Images):
In Codespaces: git add .
git commit -m "Level1: finished 02 Links and Images (added gallery + links)"
git push

In GitHub:
	1.	Go to your repo → Actions tab
	2.	Confirm your commit shows a green checkmark
	3.	Click on it if you want to see the details of your successful build

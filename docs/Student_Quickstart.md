# 🚀 Student Quick Start — GETTING STARTED (STEAMforME)

Welcome, Steamers! 👋 This is your guide to start coding in **Tazahnae’s SandCastle**.  
Follow these steps to complete **Level 1** and earn your badge.

---

## 1️⃣ Get Your Repo
- If your teacher gave you a link → **click it** to open your assignment.  
- If not, use the template:  
  👉 <https://github.com/Tazahnae/tazahnaes-sandcastle>  
  Click **Use this template** → name it (example: `my-sandcastle`) → **Create**.

---

## 2️⃣ Open a File
1. Go to `python/level1/hello_01.py`.  
2. Click the ✏️ pencil (edit).  
3. You’ll see a **TODO** inside the file.  
4. Replace the TODO with your code.  

---

## 3️⃣ Save Your Work
- At the bottom of the page, write a short message (example: `finish hello`).  
- Click **Commit changes**.  
- ✅ This saves your work to GitHub.

---

## 4️⃣ Check If You Passed
1. Click the **Actions** tab.  
2. Open the latest run called **Python tests**.  
3. Look for:  
   - ✅ → You passed!  
   - ❌ → Something’s wrong → go back, fix, commit again.  

---

## 5️⃣ Repeat for the Other Files
- `variables_02.py`  
- `loops_03.py`  
- `is_even_04.py`  

---

## 🔑 Git Terms (what’s happening behind the scenes)
- **commit** → save your changes (like a checkpoint in a game).  
- **push** → send your saved work to GitHub.  
- **pull** → bring down the latest updates from GitHub.  

👉 On GitHub web, you don’t type these. You just **write a commit message** and click **Commit changes**.

---

## 🏅 Badge

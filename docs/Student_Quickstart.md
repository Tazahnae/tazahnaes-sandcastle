# 🚀 Student Quick Start — GETTING STARTED (STEAMforME)

Welcome, Steamers! 👋 This is your guide to start coding in **Tazahnae’s SandCastle**.  
Follow these steps to complete your levels and earn your badge.

---

## 1️⃣ Open Your Assignment
- If your teacher gave you a **GitHub Classroom link** → click it.  
  - This will automatically create your assignment repo.  
- **If not, use the template:**  
  👉 <https://github.com/Tazahnae/tazahnaes-sandcastle>  
  - Click **Use this template**  
  - Name it (example: `my-sandcastle`)  
   

💡 No setup needed: you don’t need to install Python on your laptop — everything runs in Codespaces.

---

## 2️⃣ Open in GitHub Codespaces
All coding must be done in **GitHub Codespaces**.

1. Go to your assignment repo on GitHub.  
2. Click the green **Code** button.  
3. Select **Open with Codespaces** → **Create Codespace on main**.  
4. Wait for Codespaces to load:  
   - **Files** → left side  
   - **Terminal** → bottom  

> If you don’t see the Terminal, click **View → Terminal**.

---

## 3️⃣ Use the Terminal (Start Python)
The **Terminal** is the box at the bottom where you type commands for the computer.  
Think of it as “talking” directly to Python.

Start Python inside Codespaces:
```bash
python
You should see:Python 3.x.x (main, ...)
>>>
From here you can import and run your functions.
👉 To exit Python, type:exit()

🔑 Git Terms You Need to Know
Add → tell Git which files you want to save (stage changes).
Commit → save a snapshot of your work with a message (like a checkpoint in a game).
Push → upload your commits from Codespaces to GitHub (send progress to the cloud).
Pull → download the latest updates from GitHub to your Codespace.
Actions → GitHub’s automatic checker that tests your code and shows ✅ or ❌.
👉 In Codespaces, clicking Commit & Push performs add, commit, and push for you.

4️⃣ Save Your Work (Commit & Push)
When you finish editing a file:
Write a short commit message (example: finish hello).
Click Commit & Push.
✅ This saves your work and sends it to GitHub.

5️⃣ Check Your Work with Actions
On GitHub (not Codespaces), click the Actions tab.
Find the workflow called Python tests.
Open the latest run:
✅ Green check → You passed!
❌ Red X → Fix your code in Codespaces and Commit & Push again.

6️⃣ Earn Your Badge
Finish all required tasks in the python/level1/ folder.
Create a Pull Request titled:
Completed Level 1 – Python

In the PR description, paste this badge code:![Python Loops Ninja](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-Loops%20Ninja-blue)
It will display like this:

Wait for your teacher’s review and final ✅

🎉 That’s it, Steamers!
Always open your assignment through the Classroom link (or template if needed)
Always use Codespaces
Always type python in the Terminal to start coding
Always Commit & Push to save
Always check Actions for ✅ before moving on
